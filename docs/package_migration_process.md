# Package Migration Process

## Overview

Package migration is one of the three main migration types supported by the BIMigrator-Cognos system, alongside report migration and module migration. This document outlines the process of migrating Cognos Framework Manager packages to Power BI.

A Cognos Framework Manager (FM) package represents a complete data model with query subjects, relationships, calculations, and filters. The package migration process extracts these components from the FM package file and converts them into a Power BI data model.

## Migration Flow

The package migration process follows these main steps:

1. **Initialization**: Set up the migration environment and validate credentials
2. **Extraction**: Extract package components using specialized extractors
3. **Conversion**: Convert extracted components to Power BI structures
4. **Generation**: Generate Power BI project files
5. **Post-Processing**: Consolidate models and generate documentation
6. **Validation**: Validate the migrated package

### 1. Entry Points

The main entry points for package migration are:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
def migrate_package_with_explicit_session(package_file_path: str,
                                       output_path: str,
                                       cognos_url: str, session_key: str,
                                       folder_id: str = None,
                                       cpf_file_path: str = None,
                                       task_id: Optional[str] = None,
                                       auth_key: str = "IBM-BA-Authorization") -> bool:
    """Migrate a Cognos Framework Manager package file to Power BI with explicit session credentials"""
    # Implementation details...
```

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
def migrate_package_with_reports_explicit_session(package_file_path: str,
                                       output_path: str,
                                       cognos_url: str, session_key: str,
                                       report_ids: List[str] = None,
                                       cpf_file_path: str = None,
                                       task_id: Optional[str] = None,
                                       auth_key: str = "IBM-BA-Authorization") -> bool:
    """Migrate a Cognos Framework Manager package file with explicit session credentials and specific reports"""
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Detailed Migration Process

#### 2.1. Initialization

The migration process begins with initializing the environment:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Generate task ID if not provided
if task_id is None:
    task_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Configure logging
configure_logging()

# Set task info for WebSocket updates
set_task_info(task_id, total_steps=8)

# Create Cognos config with explicit values
cognos_config = CognosConfig(
    base_url=cognos_url,
    auth_key=auth_key,
    auth_value=session_key,
    session_timeout=3600,
    max_retries=3,
    request_timeout=30
)
```

#### 2.2. Directory Structure Setup

The migration process creates the following directory structure:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Create output directory structure
output_dir = Path(output_path)
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Create subdirectories
extracted_dir = output_dir / "extracted"
extracted_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

pbit_dir = output_dir / "pbit"
pbit_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

#### 2.3. Package Extraction

The package extraction process uses the `ConsolidatedPackageExtractor` to extract components from the FM package file:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Create package extractor
package_extractor = ConsolidatedPackageExtractor(logger=logging.getLogger(__name__))

# Extract package information
package_info = package_extractor.extract_package(package_file_path, str(extracted_dir))

# Save extracted information
with open(extracted_dir / "package_info.json", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(package_info, f, indent=2)
```

The `ConsolidatedPackageExtractor` coordinates several specialized extractors:

1. **PackageStructureExtractor**: Extracts the overall structure of the package
2. **PackageQuerySubjectExtractor**: Extracts query subjects (tables and views)
3. **PackageRelationshipExtractor**: Extracts relationships between query subjects
4. **PackageCalculationExtractor**: Extracts calculated columns and measures
5. **PackageFilterExtractor**: Extracts filters and security rules

#### 2.4. Report Extraction (Optional)

If report IDs are provided (in `migrate_package_with_reports_explicit_session`), the system also extracts report specifications:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Create Cognos client
client = CognosClient(cognos_config)

# Download report specifications for each report ID
report_specs = []

if report_ids:
    for report_id in report_ids:
        try:
            # Get report spec
            report_spec = client.get_report_spec(report_id)
            
            # Save report spec
            report_specs.append(report_spec)
            
            # Save to file
            with open(reports_dir / f"report_{report_id}.xml", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(report_spec)
        except Exception as e:
            log_warning(f"Failed to download report spec for report ID {report_id}: {e}")
```

#### 2.5. Data Model Conversion

The extracted package information is converted to a Power BI data model:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Convert to data model
data_model = package_extractor.convert_to_data_model(package_info)

# Consolidate tables if needed
consolidate_model_tables(str(extracted_dir))
```

The conversion process includes:

1. **Query Subject Processing**: Converting query subjects to tables
   - Database query subjects (direct SQL)
   - Model query subjects (derived from other query subjects)
   - Other query subjects

2. **Column Processing**: Converting columns with appropriate data types
   - Mapping Cognos data types to Power BI data types
   - Handling calculated columns

3. **Relationship Processing**: Converting relationships between query subjects
   - Identifying join columns
   - Creating relationships with appropriate cardinality

#### 2.6. Power BI Project Creation

A Power BI project is created from the data model:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Create Power BI project
pbi_project = PowerBIProject(
    name=package_info['name'],
    data_model=data_model
)
```

#### 2.7. Power BI File Generation

The Power BI project files are generated:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Create generator
config = MigrationConfig(
    template_directory=str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'templates'),
    llm_service_url=os.environ.get('DAX_API_URL', 'http://localhost:8080'),
    llm_service_enabled=True
)
generator = PowerBIProjectGenerator(config=config)

# Generate Power BI project files
success = generator.generate_project(pbi_project, pbit_dir)
```

This generates the following files in the `pbit_dir` directory:
- `Report.pbir` - Power BI report definition
- `DataModel.tmdl` - Power BI data model
- `DiagramLayout.json` - Layout information for the model diagram
- `Settings.json` - Project settings

### 5. Post-Processing

After the initial migration, post-processing steps include:

#### 5.1. Model Consolidation

If multiple reports are migrated, their data models are consolidated:

```python
# In cognos_migrator/migrations/package.py
# Consolidate tables if needed
consolidate_model_tables(str(extracted_dir))
```

This consolidation process:
- Merges tables with the same name
- Resolves column conflicts
- Preserves relationships
- Optimizes the data model

#### 5.2. Documentation Generation

Documentation is generated for the migrated package:

- Data model documentation
- Table and column listings
- Relationship diagrams
- Migration summary

### 6. Validation and Testing

To ensure the quality and reliability of package migrations, the following validation and testing approaches are recommended:

1. **Manual Validation**:
   - Compare the migrated Power BI data model with the original Cognos package
   - Verify that all query subjects, calculations, and relationships are correctly migrated
   - Check that the data model structure matches the expected output
   - Validate that queries return the same results in both systems

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Develop unit tests for each package extractor
   - Create integration tests for the end-to-end package migration process
   - Implement regression tests to ensure that fixes don't break existing functionality
   - Use snapshot testing to compare migration outputs with expected results

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure and benchmark migration times for packages of different sizes
   - Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in the extraction and conversion process
   - Test memory usage for large packages to ensure scalability

4. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Test the system's behavior with invalid or malformed package inputs
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are generated
   - Ensure that partial failures don't prevent the migration of other components

5. **Cross-Package Testing**:
   - Test migrations involving multiple related packages
   - Verify that relationships between packages are correctly maintained
   - Test the consolidation of models from different packages
